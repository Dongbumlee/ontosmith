# CLI reference

Every `ontosmith` command and its options, captured
from the live `--help` surface of the unified CLI
(`pipeline/__main__.py` dispatches each command to its
module). This file is maintained verbatim from the live
`--help` surface, not generated: refresh it by hand
after any CLI change (each block below is the verbatim
output of the shown invocation, ANSI escapes stripped).

Invoke as `ontosmith <command> ...` from an install,
or `python -m pipeline <command> ...` from a clone.

  --pack PACK           domain pack binding this batch (pack_id, family, or

                        as core baseline + this pack and frozen into the batch
                        directory (default: the pack bound to the --profile

  --max-cost-usd MAX_COST_USD
                        stop-line: hard spend cap for the batch (default: the

                        a cost-less binding; the ledger then records tokens
                        and marks cost not-provided)

> ([connections.md](connections.md#neo4j--the-graph-store-required-for-builds)).

> **Reading the WRITE metrics.** The batch record's
> `metrics.write` carries the write stage's counts. Two

>
> - **`relations_unmapped`** — the number of written
>   triples whose surface relation matched nothing at
>   WRITE: not the profile's `label_categories`
>   vocabulary, not its explicit `relation_map`, and
>   unchanged by the deterministic canonicalization
>   (case/whitespace folding, auxiliary stripping,
>   `_`-joining). An unmapped relation is not dropped:
>   it is stored **unchanged** and counted here. The
>   per-surface breakdown is the batch directory's
>   `relation_map.json` (`unmapped_surfaces`) — the
>   report the map grows from. **`relation_layers`**
>   beside the count gives the written relations per
>   normalization layer: `vocab` / `map` / `normalized`
>   / `surface`.
> - **`er_review_pairs`** — entity-resolution pairs the
>   WRITE stage held in the review band instead of
>   merging: cross-document pairs the ER gate scored
>   below the merge threshold, second-opinion flags,
>   and pairs the pack's `merge_prohibited_type_pairs`
>   forbids. Each held pair is **recorded** — in the
>   registry's `er_decisions` table with
>   `outcome='review'` (the pair, the gate's `p_same`,
>   the model, and the reason where one applies), in
>   the run log as it is held, and in this count — and
>   both entities stay in the graph as separate nodes.
>   A held pair is settled by a human through
>   `batch er-review` (the pairs, with their evidence)
>   → `batch er-decide` (a recorded merge /
>   keep-separate decision) → `batch er-apply` (the
>   merges re-projected into the graph) — see the three
>   commands below. The decision is append-only: the
>   hold stays on record and the settlement lands
>   beside it in the same table.

#### `ontosmith ontology import`

`ontosmith ontology import --help`:

                                 OUT [--scoping-out SCOPING_OUT]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --spec SPEC           scoping spec JSON (the human judgment: per-type
                        sources, actions, boundary material, drops with
                        reasons)
  --inventory INVENTORY
                        source-ontology inventory JSON (repeatable: module
                        file + reference files)
  --out OUT             draft JSON path

```

The BYO-schema door (hands-on Track 4): consumes a
mechanically extracted inventory of an external
OWL/RDF ontology plus a human-authored scoping spec,
and emits an ordinary builder draft plus the scoping
record — the complete per-concept account (kept /
merged / flattened / role-converted / demoted /
dropped with reasons). The draft then passes the
same validate → approve → emit gates as a drafted
schema; the import is fail-closed (every concept in
the spec's scoped files must be accounted for exactly
once).

### `ontosmith inspect` — Evidence/provenance viewer: one triple, its evidence + provenance

`ontosmith inspect --help`:

```text
usage: ontosmith inspect [-h] [--index INDEX] [--subject SUBJECT]
                         [--relation RELATION] [--object OBJECT] [--json]
                         artefact

Evidence/provenance viewer: print one triple with its evidence
spans and provenance chain

positional arguments:
  artefact             triple-records JSONL/.json file, or a batch directory

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --index INDEX        index among matching triples (default: first match)
  --subject SUBJECT    subject substring filter
  --relation RELATION  relation substring filter

  --json               print the inspection report as JSON instead of the
                       report card
```

Point `inspect` at a **batch directory** for the full
view — resolved names, quoted evidence, provenance.
Pointed at a bare records file it degrades (`ent:` IDs,
"(none recorded)" evidence, a Gaps section): a file alone
carries no registry context. One Gaps line — `no
batch/status provenance recorded` — can appear even in
the directory form; it reports that the triple record
itself carries no batch/status fields (batch provenance
lives in the batch manifest and status), not that
evidence is missing.

### `ontosmith search` — Hybrid search over a built graph (chunks + triples)

                        query

Hybrid search over a built graph: lexical + vector + graph
retrieval over the build's chunks and triples

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        serving store: auto = Neo4j when NEO4J_URL is
                        configured, else the file store (default: auto)
  --k K                 max documents / triples returned (default: 10)
  --embed               activate the vector arm via the connection layer's
                        default embedder (refuses if the embedder seat's key
                        is unset)
  --json                print the result as JSON instead of the report card
```

> **Which graph a Neo4j search answers from.** The
> Neo4j store holds exactly one graph — the current
> build's, stamped at WRITE with its ontology identity
> ([connections.md](connections.md)) — and a Neo4j
> search answers from that graph; there is no scope
> option because there is nothing to scope between.
> `--batch` / `--source` beside `--store neo4j` (or an
> auto-selected Neo4j) names the build you *expect*:
> if the store's current graph is a different build's,
> the search refuses by name (build the named one to
> make its graph the store's, or drop the name). A
> store with no stamped graph refuses the same way,
> saying whether it is empty or holds unstamped
> content. With `--store file`, `--batch` / `--source`
> select the artifact read-back instead, exactly as
> before. `serve` follows the same rules.
