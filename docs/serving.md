# Serving: search and the sample API

A built graph is only useful if you can ask it
questions. OntoSmith serves one through two faces of
the same surface — a `search` command (and its library
form) and a small sample HTTP API — plus a minimal
demo app over that API, the test-by-using surface.
A build's graph lives in **Neo4j** (the graph store —
[connections.md](connections.md)), and serving a build
reads it from there.

The same surface also runs over a **file store**, which
reads recorded artifacts directly — the shipped demo,
or a finished batch's on-disk records. That is the
keyless demo / read-back path, and it is **degraded by
design**: the file store carries no embeddings, so the
**vector arm never runs** on it — lexical and graph
arms only, exactly as the `arms` line of every result
says. It is a way to inspect recordings, not a second
place a build can live.

Everything below was executed against the shipped
example build (the Alder & Finch studio — 7 triples,
4 documents), so you can reproduce every line before
building anything of your own.

## The 30-second version

```bash
python -m pipeline search "Who founded Alder & Finch?"
python -m pipeline serve   # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

No keys, no database, no build step — the example
ships with the package.

## `ontosmith search`

```console
$ python -m pipeline search "Who founded Alder & Finch?"
Search  'Who founded Alder & Finch?'

    "Alder & Finch is a ceramics studio founded in 2011 by Mara Alder and Tomas Finch."
  …
```

(The document excerpts and triple list are trimmed
here; the command prints them in full.)

What a search returns, in order:

- **Entities** — the names in your question, linked
  to graph entities deterministically (exact,
  token-set, then substring match over canonical
  names and registry aliases — no model call).
- **Documents** — the hybrid ranking: a lexical
  (full-text) arm and, when the store carries
  embeddings, a vector arm, fused per document with
  reciprocal-rank fusion — the same definitions the
  evaluation harness (`harness/`) measures.
- **Triples** — the graph arm: accepted triples whose
  subject/relation/object overlap the question,
  ranked by overlap weighted with each triple's
  judged probability, each with its evidence quote
  and source document.
- **Graph documents** (in `--json`) — the documents
  behind those triples, ranked the same way.

The card names the arms that actually ran
(`arms    lexical · graph` above). An arm that
cannot run — no embeddings in the store, no triple
overlap — is absent from the list and explained in
the JSON's `notes`, never silently implied.

**Language.** Query tokenization is script-aware:
Latin, Hangul, CJK, kana, Cyrillic and other scripts
tokenize on whitespace and punctuation, so a
Korean-only question fires the lexical and graph
arms like an English one. It is whitespace
tokenization, not morphological analysis — a Korean
particle attached to a noun does not match the bare
noun, so questions phrased with bare entity names
match best. On the store side, the full-text
indexes take an analyzer chosen per deployment
(`ONTOSMITH_FULLTEXT_ANALYZER`,
[connections.md](connections.md)); stock Neo4j
bundles no Korean morphological analyzer, and `cjk`
(bigram) is the closest shipped option.

```bash
python -m pipeline search --json "Dune stoneware dinnerware"
python -m pipeline search --k 5 --batch my-batch-id "…"
python -m pipeline search --source path/to/build "…"
```

### Which store answers?

One rule set, shared with the API:

| You did this | Store |
|---|---|
| `--store neo4j`, or `NEO4J_URL` is set | Neo4j — the store's one current graph (below) |
| `--store file` | the file store, whatever the environment says |
| `--batch <id>` | with the file store: that batch's artifacts under the state root (read-back). With Neo4j: the build you expect the store to hold — a name to check, not a scope |
| `--source <dir>` | with the file store: a batch directory, or a records directory like the example. With Neo4j: the same expectation check, by directory name |
| nothing | with Neo4j configured: the store's current graph. Otherwise: the shipped example build |

**The Neo4j store holds one graph** — the current
build's, stamped at WRITE with the identity of the
ontology that produced it ([connections.md](connections.md)).
Serving resolves that graph from the stamp: there is
no scope to specify, and no question of which build
you are searching — the store can only hold one.

A
`--batch` or `--source` beside `--store neo4j` names
the build you *expect*; if the store's current graph
is a different build's, serving refuses by name
(build the named one to make its graph the store's,
or drop the name and serve what is there). A store
with no stamped graph — empty, or holding content no
build stamped — refuses the same way, saying which.

Chunk retrieval is pinned to that one graph's build,
so no arm can range over a replaced graph's documents.

The file store reads a batch's routed attestations,
source texts and chunk index, or a records directory
(`triples.jsonl` + `corpus/*.txt`, the example's
shape — chunked deterministically at load).

Entity
identity comes from the build's registry when one is
present next to the source. A store that cannot
answer — a missing source, an unreachable Neo4j —
refuses with a named error; it never falls back to a
different store quietly.

Point it at your own finished build (file read-back;
with `NEO4J_URL` configured the same command checks
the name against the store's current graph):

```bash
python -m pipeline search --batch 2026-10-01T120000Z-ab12cd34 "your question"
```

### The library form

```python
from pipeline.search import hybrid_search, open_store

store = open_store()                    # same selection rules
result = hybrid_search(store, "Who founded Alder & Finch?", k=10)
result["documents"][0]["doc_id"]       # 'alder-finch-history'
result["triples"][0]["relation"]        # 'founded by'
```

An embedder (the connections layer's embedding seat)
is used only when the store actually carries chunk
embeddings — the search never spends an embedding
call a store cannot answer from.

## The sample API: `ontosmith serve`

A small HTTP API over the same surface, so a demo
app — or your own frontend — can sit on top. It is
deliberately a *sample*: standard-library HTTP, no
framework dependency, localhost by default.

```console
$ python -m pipeline serve
ontosmith serve: file store (7 triples, 4 documents) at http://127.0.0.1:8765 — /search /entity /neighborhood /triple /health
ontosmith serve: demo app at http://127.0.0.1:8765/ (assets: …/app)
```

| Endpoint | Parameters | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | — | status + the serving store's description |
| `GET /search` | `q` (required), `k` (1–100, default 10) | the search result above, as JSON |
| `GET /entity` | `id` or `name` | the entity, its aliases, and every triple it takes part in |
| `GET /neighborhood` | `id` or `name`, `hops` (1–4, default 1) | the entity's neighborhood: nodes + evidence-carrying edges |
| `GET /triple` | `index`, or any of `subject` / `relation` / `object` | one triple **with its evidence quote and provenance** |

```bash
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
{"status": "ok", "store": {"kind": "file", "source": "…/examples", "batch_id": "examples", "entities": 7, "triples": 7, "documents": 4, "chunks": 4, "embeddings": false}}

$ curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8765/triple?subject=Priya"
{"source": "api", "position": 5, "triples": 7, "triple": {"subject": "Priya Nair", "relation": "joined", "object": "Alder & Finch"}, "evidence": [{"kind": "quote", "text": "Priya Nair joined Alder & Finch in 2019 as its glaze chemist."}], "provenance": {"doc_id": "alder-finch-people", "batch_id": "examples", "tier": 1, "tag": "VERIFIED", "p_true": 0.95}, "gaps": []}

$ curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8765/entity?name=Nobody"   # HTTP 404
{"error": {"code": "entity_not_found", "message": "no entity matches name 'Nobody'"}}
```

Errors are one shape everywhere —
`{"error": {"code", "message"}}` — with named codes:
`missing_parameter` and `invalid_parameter` (400),
`entity_not_found`, `triple_not_found`, `not_found`
(404). The store is chosen by the same flags as the
CLI (`serve --batch …`, `serve --store neo4j`,
`--host` / `--port` to move the bind).

## The demo app: test-drive the graph

`ontosmith serve` also serves a small demo app at
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/` — the test-by-using surface
next to the harness's test-by-data. It is four static
files (`app/` in the repository: plain HTML/CSS/JS,
no build step, no external assets, so it works
offline) over the same API — no second backend,
nothing to configure:

```console
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{content_type}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8765/
200 text/html; charset=utf-8
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{content_type}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8765/app/app.js
200 text/javascript; charset=utf-8
```

What it does, and only this:

- **Search box.** The same hybrid search as the CLI,
  organized the way the CLI's card is: linked
  entities, ranked documents, evidence-carrying
  triples — with the arms that ran named at the top
  and every skipped-arm note printed verbatim,
  exactly as the API reports them.
- **Triple inspector.** Click any triple and the app
  fetches its inspection report (`/triple`): the
  statement, the evidence quote, the full provenance
  chain, and the report's *gaps* — the accountability
  aspects the record does not carry — named, not
  hidden.
- **Entity report.** Click an entity — a search chip,
  a triple's subject or object, a neighbor — for
  every fact it takes part in, split as-subject /
  as-object.
- **Neighborhood walker.** From an entity report,
  walk the graph one entity at a time over
  `/neighborhood` (1–4 hops): each neighbor is a row
  naming the relation, the tier, and the judged
  probability of the edge that reaches it.

Graph *rendering* is deliberately not in the app —
there is no custom canvas. When the store is Neo4j,
the overview panel links to **Neo4j Browser** on the
same host as the Bolt endpoint (port 7474 next to
7687) with a starter Cypher query; no credentials
ever reach the page (the password is a separate
binding the API never exposes).

An embedded rendered
explorer belongs to the fuller app (v1.1); on the
file store, the walker above is the exploration
path. The app is read-only, like the API under it.

## What serving does *not* do

- **No generative answers.** Search returns ranked
  documents, linked entities and evidence-carrying
  triples; composing a prose answer from them is the
  caller's job (the evaluation harness's answerer
  stays an evaluation tool, not a product surface).
- **No writes.** Serving is read-only; builds happen
  through the pipeline commands.
- **No auth, no TLS.** The sample API binds
  localhost for local demos. Put a real server in
  front of it before exposing it anywhere.
