**An ontology-driven knowledge-graph builder: design the
ontology, build the graph under it, and serve it — search,
API, and app — from one pipeline.**

*Powered by Jev — the decision (judge) model inside
OntoSmith — and built on Neo4j, the graph store
underneath, with native vector search.*

The stack has two named pillars: **Jev** judges what is
true enough to write, and **Neo4j** stores the graph —
native graph traversal, a vector index, and full-text
search in one store. A build requires both.

Most knowledge-graph tooling starts from whatever a model
happens to extract. OntoSmith starts from the ontology:
you design the schema first — entity and relation types,
definitions, boundary examples — a human approves it, and
the graph is then built *under* that schema by a pipeline
that separates proposing from judging. Models propose
candidates; a fitted pair call converts enumerated pairs
into candidate triples, and deterministic gates and the
Jev decision model decide what is true enough to write.
Every written triple
carries its evidence span and provenance, and every build
prices itself before it spends.

![OntoSmith build loop: models propose, Jev judges, only judged facts are written](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/raw/main/docs/assets/build-loop.webp)

*The method in one loop, on a real build's neighborhood:
cheap models propose candidate facts, the Jev decision
model judges each against its evidence, and only judged
facts are written — every one traceable back to its
span. (Illustration: proposed and rejected candidates
are shown schematically; the written graph is the
flagship build's.)*

## What the schema is — and is not

The ontology here is a **flat extraction contract**: a
closed inventory of entity and relation types, each with
a definition and boundary examples — drafted from your
corpus or imported, approved by a human, and enforced
type by type by the decision model. It is deliberately
*not* a formal ontology: there is no class hierarchy,
no inheritance, and no logical axioms — OntoSmith is
not an OWL ontology editor, and it runs no inference
or reasoning over the graph. The flatness is the point:
judged per-type decisions are what make a build's
quality measurable, and hierarchy would blur exactly
those decisions. The job this shape is production-shaped
for is narrower and concrete: turn a document corpus
into a governed, evidence-carrying graph that search
and agents can answer from.

*A real build, not a mock-up: the two parties' neighborhood

span and provenance. Corpus: CUAD (The Atticus Project),

## Try it — step 1 needs no API key

**Requirements**

- **OS** — Linux (developed and tested on Linux).
  Windows: run under **WSL2** — native Windows is not
  a tested platform.
- **Python** ≥ 3.11.
- **An LLM connection** — only for step 3 and live
  builds; steps 1–2 run keyless.
- **Neo4j** (5.x, Community Edition is enough) — the
  graph store a live build writes into; only step 3
  needs it running. Setup in
  [Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md).

**Step 1 · Look around (no key, two minutes).**
Install from PyPI:

```console
$ pip install ontosmith
$ ontosmith profile examples/corpus --family demo
Corpus profile
  family          demo
  status          COMPLETE
  documents       4
  claims          6
  decision points 0
  profile hash    sha256:7ae51d31fa9120ec
  spend           $0.0000
  written         profiles/demo (profile.json, setup_config.json, profile.md)

$ ontosmith inspect examples/triples.jsonl
Triple  (1 of 7 in examples/triples.jsonl)
  subject   Alder & Finch
  relation  founded by
  object    Mara Alder
Evidence
  [quote] Alder & Finch is a ceramics studio founded in 2011 by Mara Alder and Tomas Finch.
Provenance
  doc_id               alder-finch-history
  tier                 1
  p_true               0.98
```

`p_true` is the judge's ranking score for the triple —
a score to sort and threshold by, not a calibrated
probability.

The profiler is deterministic — the same corpus yields
the same profile hash on every run — and the example's
build output ships as a recorded artefact, so inspection
runs offline too. Profiling, inspecting, validating, and
the verification math all run keyless; the full list is
in [Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md).

Ask the shipped example build a question — retrieval
over the recorded artefacts, still no key:

```console
$ ontosmith search "Who founded Alder & Finch?"
```

And `profile` runs the same way on **your own** folder:
point it at any corpus directory to see whether it fits
before any build.

**Step 2 · Check the evidence (no key).** The flagship
build's corrected scoring replays from its shipped
adjudication appendix — no model calls, and the script
exits non-zero if any figure drifts:
`python examples/demo/replay_scores.py`
([appendix track](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/hands-on-appendix.md)). Every
headline figure maps to the command that recomputes it
in [reproduce/](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/tree/main/reproduce).

**Step 3 · Build with your own connection.** The
prerequisites, gathered in one place:

1. **Declare the binding** — `ontosmith configure`
   walks the seats from the preset's values, probes
   the result with zero spend, and writes the bindings
   file. For the reference preset, accept the defaults
   and set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — the same key reaches
   every seat, the judge included
   ([Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md) explains the
   route and how to bind your own provider instead).
   One LLM connection is the only *model* connection
   a build needs; [Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md)
   covers the seats it plugs into and the recommended
   models.
2. **Nothing else to install** — candidates are
   proposed by the proposer seat (a model call);
   there is no local NLP stack. (A GLiNER+spaCy
   pipeline candidate source and its `ontosmith[nlp]`
   extra existed until 2026-10-29 and were retired —
   the LLM proposer is the only candidate source.)
3. **Neo4j running** — the build needs it: it is the
   graph store WRITE, INDEX, and VERIFY work in.
   Install it, set its password, and export
   `NEO4J_PASSWORD` (a local default install needs
   nothing else; the connection variables and setup
   are in [Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md)). The run
   probes the store before the first stage and refuses
   by name if it is not serving, so a missing store
   costs no spend.

Cost, with its scope: the four-document demo subset
prices at roughly $1–2 end to end, fixed overhead
included. A full corpus prices from the counted
projection before it runs (Cost guardrails, below).
The flagship run's governing total prices at 3.8¢ per
document over 500 documents — key-observed; the run's
counted ledger reads 3.7¢ (whitepaper §5.6).

Then the [hands-on guide](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/hands-on.md) (Track 1)
walks a live build on your own documents end to end —
profile, create, capped run, and the serve / search /
inspect finish line. A run whose key is missing
refuses before any stage starts, with the error naming
the seat and the variable to set.

Optional surfaces install as extras:
`pip install "ontosmith[viz]"`.
(The `"ontosmith[neo4j]"` extra installs the official
driver the export utilities use; the build itself talks
to Neo4j over HTTP and needs the server, not the extra.)

## What's in the box

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| Batch pipeline | The staged build: ingest → NER/roster → candidates → gates → route → write → index → verify, under a versioned pack, with a ledger-enforced spend cap |
| Corpus profiler | `ontosmith profile` — a deterministic census of your corpus and the decision points a human should settle first |
| Ontology builder | `ontosmith ontology` — drafts a domain schema from a profile, or imports an external ontology under a recorded scoping; deterministic validation; emits a hash-pinned pack only after explicit human approval |
| Four domain packs + Core baseline | Domain ontologies as data — schema, definitions, boundary examples, thresholds, measured conformance record (below) |
| Verification cores | `ontosmith verify` — raw *and* audit-corrected scoring, ceiling-adjusted recall, failure anatomy, counted cost projections |
| Evidence appendix | The flagship record's adjudication samples and verdicts, shipped for replay (`benchmarks/appendix/`) |
| Serving | Hybrid retrieval (vector + lexical + graph) via `ontosmith search` and a sample API — over the build's Neo4j store; the shipped demo's recorded artifacts also serve from files (lexical + graph arms only — no vector arm) |
| Demo + guide | A smoke corpus, a fetchable demo subset, and the hands-on guide that walks the whole loop in four tracks |

## The loop

Two artifacts carry the loop, and they are not the same
thing. A **profile** describes **your corpus**: a
deterministic census — document inventory, conventions,
decision points — that `ontosmith profile` produces with
no model calls, pinned by its hash. A **pack** carries
a **domain's ontology as data**: the type inventory,
definitions, and boundary examples a build runs under,
versioned and pinned by sha256, with the conformance
record of what its content measured. A batch binds one
of each.

1. **Profile** — `ontosmith profile` censuses your corpus
   first (deterministic, no LLM): document inventory,
   conventions, and the decision points a human should
   settle before any build.
2. **Design** — `ontosmith ontology` drafts a domain
   schema from the profile, validates it deterministically,
   and emits it as a versioned, hash-pinned **pack** only
   after an explicit human approval.
3. **Build** — `ontosmith batch` runs the staged pipeline
   under the pack. Measured operating points ship as
   defaults; the run's cost is capped by a stop-line, and
   countable before it starts (`verify project`).
4. **Inspect** — `ontosmith inspect` shows any triple with
   its evidence span and provenance chain — and names what
   is missing when something is.
5. **Verify** — `ontosmith verify` ships the measurement
   tooling with the product: audit your own gold, score
   your own builds raw *and* corrected, with the failure
   anatomy attached.
6. **Serve** — `ontosmith search` and the sample API
   (`ontosmith serve`) answer hybrid retrieval
   (vector + lexical + graph) over chunks and triples.
   A build is served from its Neo4j store; the shipped
   demo's recorded artifacts also serve from files —
   the keyless read-back path, lexical + graph arms
   only.

## The method

![The OntoSmith method: proposer/judge separation across the build loop](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/raw/main/docs/assets/method.png)

One separation runs through everything: nothing is
written on the proposing seat's say-so alone. A fitted
pair call converts enumerated pairs into candidate
triples; deterministic gates check them; the Jev
decision model **decides** what is written.

Operating
points — thresholds, the enumeration window, the judge
configuration — are chosen by pre-registered measurement
gates, not by feel, and configurations that miss their
gate stay off (the rejections are in the quality record).
The full loop, walked end to end, is the
[hands-on guide](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/hands-on.md).

## How this differs from GraphRAG-style pipelines

GraphRAG-style pipelines typically centre the build on
a single frontier-class model, and evaluate the result
by its answers (or by extraction scores on someone
else's benchmark), rather than by adjudicating the
graph they actually built.

OntoSmith divides the job:
a low-cost proposer proposes, a fitted pair call
converts enumerated pairs into candidates,
deterministic gates check form, and the pinned Jev
model decides what is written — nothing is written on
the proposer's say-so alone. Types come from an
explicit, versioned ontology rather than emerging from
the extraction, and the published record scores the
graph itself, verdicts attached (§ Quality). If you
want emergent structure and a working demo fast, the
GraphRAG family gets you there sooner; this one is for
when the graph has to be audited.

## Three documents, three edges

A chunk store returns text and leaves the connections
in it implicit. A graph makes each connection an edge:
typed, directed, and carrying the sentence that
supports it. Three real items from this project's own
records:

**News — a head of government named inside somebody
else's article.** The article is about Abdul Jabar
Sabet, an Afghan politician; one sentence in it
carries a fact whose subject is a country:

> Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime
> Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

As an edge — Afghanistan — *head of government* →
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar — the fact answers to its own
subject: a question about Afghanistan's former prime
minister traverses straight to the name, with the
sentence attached as evidence. (Adjudication appendix
item B-193, judged *supported*.)

**A novel — a character who enters by relation, not
by cast list.** Zola's *Le Ventre de Paris* never
lists its cast; Quenu arrives through the plot:

> He returns to his step-brother Quenu, a charcutier
> and his wife Lisa Quenu (formerly Macquart), with
> whom he finds refuge.

As an edge — *Le Ventre de Paris* — *characters* →
Quenu — the character becomes a node: reachable,
countable, and linked onward through the relations
the sentence states (step-brother to Florent, husband
to Lisa). (Appendix item B-151, judged *supported*.)

**A contract — a defined term is an identity, not a
string.** A CUAD agreement stipulates its vocabulary
as it goes:

> The term of this Agreement shall be ten (10) years
> (the "Term") which shall commence on the date upon
> which the Company delivers to Distributor the last
> Sample, as defined hereinafter.

"Term", "the Company", "Distributor" are defined
names inside this document. The build collects the
terms a document stipulates into a per-document
registry and resolves defined terms to their stated
referents, so every later clause that runs "during
the Term" or "the Company shall" attaches to the same
nodes: the definition and its uses are one entity,
not a scatter of string matches. (Corpus-profile
example in the Legal Contract pack,
`packs/legal-contract/profile/profile.json`; CUAD,
CC BY 4.0.)

The two appendix items are machine-adjudicated
*supported* under the published contract (the
[appendix](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/tree/main/benchmarks/appendix)); quote spacing is
normalized from the tokenized record.

## Corpus packs

A pack is a domain's ontology as data: schema, definitions,
boundary examples, thresholds, and its measured conformance
record — hash-pinned, versioned, fail-closed on load.
Domain content lives only in packs, never in code branches.
The format's contract — manifest, pins, candidates,
conformance — is [docs/PACK_DESIGN.md](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/PACK_DESIGN.md).

| Pack | Contents | Measured on |
|---|---|---|
| **Bio Medical** (`bio-medical`) | Biomedical entity/relation schema, fitted qualifiers | BioRED (pilot record: [whitepaper](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md) §5.7) |
| **Legal Contract** (`legal-contract`) | Contract schema: 41 label categories, role-word and defined-term rules | CUAD (promotion record: [whitepaper](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md) §5.8) |
| **FIBO Contracts** (`fibo-contracts`) | Contract schema **imported from FIBO** (EDM Council, MIT): the FND Agreements module flattened under a recorded scoping — 15 entity + 13 relation types | CUAD, the same corpus as Legal Contract; emitted through the builder, so its record opens `emitted_unmeasured` — the measured account so far is the coverage record ([hands-on](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/hands-on.md) Track 4; `examples/fibo-import/`) |
| **Open Domain** (`open-domain`) | Schema for general documents, with fitted direction declarations | Re-DocRED (flagship record: [whitepaper](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md) §5) |
| **Core** (`core`, baseline) | The domain-neutral baseline every new corpus starts from | The cross-domain core record |

No pack fits your domain? The ontology builder (step 2)
drafts one from your own corpus, for your approval —
and if your domain already publishes an ontology, the
builder imports it instead (hands-on Track 4).

![The ontology builder loop: draft, validate, approve, emit](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/raw/main/docs/assets/ontology-loop.png)

*The builder loop and its refusal paths, as coded in
`pipeline/ontology_builder.py` — an emitted pack is
marked `emitted_unmeasured` until a registered
measurement adopts it.*

## Reference profile — measured bindings, your choice

The published measurements were made with one exact set of
model bindings. That set ships as the **reference
profile**, pre-filled in the connection layer as the
default preset:

| Seat | Reference binding |
|---|---|
| Proposer — extracts candidates; never decides | `anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5` |
| Judge — Jev, the decision gate; a pinned product component | `typesafe/jev-1.13` |
| Escalation — adjudication escalation; in evaluation it also serves as the comparison judge — it never decides a build's triples | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5` |
| Drafting — schema/profile drafting; an authoring aid behind the human approve gate | — (ships unbound; bind your own) |
| Embedder — indexing and question embedding | `openai/text-embedding-3-large` |

Three layers, five seats: the method's *judge* layer is
two seats in this table — the fitted pair judge, which
shares the proposer's model row, and the pinned Jev
gate — and drafting is an authoring seat outside the
build loop.

Four models, one key: the preset reaches all four named
models through a single connection key.

The names differ
per seat because each measured seat's default won its
job in measurement; the judge seat is the exception —
a pinned component, not a bake-off winner — and you can
re-point any seat ([Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md)).

**Optimized for the Jev decision model; the other seats
are yours to bind** — see
[Optimized for Jev](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md#optimized-for-jev)
in Connections.

Read that table as provenance, not as a requirement: the
preset is the environment the measurements were made in,
so a default install runs the bindings the published
numbers were measured under (the numbers themselves
reproduce keyless from the appendix — step 2) —
but OntoSmith needs *a* connection, not *this* one.

Domain packs declare only *capability tiers* (proposer /
judge / escalation), never model names, so you can bind
other models and endpoints in your own connection config;
that is a **custom binding**, and run records state which
binding produced a run. API keys are never settings
values: config names the environment variable, the value
comes from your environment. The full seat-by-seat
picture — every seat, the recommended models, and the
custom-binding contract — is
[Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md).

## Cost guardrails

Spend is guarded by default. The tooling prints a
**counted projection** before a run (`ontosmith verify
project` — candidate pairs counted from your data, priced
at rates you supply (`--unit-cost`); the tool takes
prices from the caller and never hardcodes a rate card).

Every batch enforces a
**stop-line**: a run that would cross its cap refuses to
start the unit that crosses it, and resumes from its
ledger instead of re-spending.

## Quality

How well does it work? The measured record — scores with
their scope and method, the failure anatomy, and the
pre-registered criterion that failed — lives in the
project [whitepaper](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md) (§5); the evidence data and the replay
that recomputes it ship in [`benchmarks/`](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/tree/main/benchmarks).

> **What the numbers do and don't say.** The corrected
> scores describe one measured build — the 3,902-triple
> sentence-window configuration — not the shipped
> default, which enumerates differently (whitepaper
> §5.6); the shipped Tier-1 set adds 186 promoted triples
> whose corrected precision is not recomputed. The
> adjudication is machine judging under a published,
> ruled contract — no human spot-check round has been
> run on the flagship sample. Retrieval is measured on
> one pinned 116-question set over long contracts, and
> at exactly zero on short abstracts. The whitepaper
> states each limit where the number lives (§5, §7).

## When not to use it

OntoSmith is the wrong tool if you want a graph without
an ontology: the schema-first step, the human approval
points, and the measurement tooling are the product, not
ceremony around it.

If you need a quick demo graph from a
pile of text with no quality questions asked, lighter
extraction tools will get you there faster — and if your
domain's schema is still changing daily, settle it a
little before pinning it into a pack.

## The store — Neo4j

A build's graph lives in **Neo4j**: WRITE, INDEX, and
VERIFY work in it, the graph views render through
Neo4j's own tooling on the same host, and serving a
build reads from it. It is a prerequisite for
building, not an optional backend — setup and the
connection variables are in
[Connections](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/connections.md). The store holds
**one graph** — the current build's, stamped with the
identity of the ontology that produced it: a build
under a different ontology replaces the previous graph
(named in the run's output before it happens), never
accumulates beside it, so search never needs a scope —
it answers from the one graph that is there.

Asking questions
of *recorded* artifacts needs no store: the search
command and sample API also run over a file-backed
store that reads a finished batch's records (or the
shipped demo) directly — the demo/read-back path,
whose search runs the lexical and graph arms only
([docs/serving.md](https://github.com/Dongbumlee/ontosmith/blob/main/docs/serving.md)).

## Status

Release 0.1.1, published on PyPI. The pipeline,
profiler, ontology builder, inspect viewer,
verification cores, packs, and the serving surface
(search command + sample API) in this tree are
measured, tested components, as is the minimal demo
app served with the API.
