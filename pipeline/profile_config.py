"""Profile setup_config layer.

The stage-0 corpus profile's setup_config.json is the config layer
that carries a corpus's ontology into the pipeline. Three jobs:

1. FAIL-CLOSED VALIDATION. Every key in a setup_config must have a
   registered consumer (CONSUMED_KEYS) or be declared metadata
   (METADATA_KEYS / any ``*_note`` annotation). Batch creation
   refuses a config with an unregistered key and names it. Before
   this registry existed, a key could sit in the profile forever
   with no reader: BioRED v1's entity_types / relation_types were
   consumed by NOTHING (the wiring
   audit) — the profile looked wired
   and was decoration. That state is now impossible at creation.

2. THE GUIDANCE CHANNEL. derive_guidance() renders the
   profile's schema into the guidance text stage_candidates threads
   into the proposer prompt: an explicit ``proposer_guidance``
   string wins verbatim; otherwise the ``schema_front`` inventory
   (entity types with definitions + boundary examples, relation
   inventory with endpoint signatures and extraction intents,
   merge prohibitions) is rendered deterministically. A profile
   with neither key yields "" — and with empty guidance the
   constructed proposer prompt is byte-identical to the
   pre-channel construction (pinned by
   scripts/test_profile_wiring.py).

3. TYPED MENTIONS. The helpers below define the type
   vocabulary candidates are validated against
   (endpoint_type_names) and the merge prohibitions WRITE's ER
   consults in BOTH channels (prohibited_type_pairs /
   type_pair_prohibited): config key
   ``merge_prohibited_type_pairs`` = a list of [typeA, typeB]
   unordered pairs that must never merge.

4. INDUSTRY PACKS (docs/PACK_DESIGN.md). The pack
   loader at the bottom of this module binds a versioned pack
   manifest (packs/<id>/pack.json) to the profile payload it
   pins by sha256 and returns the payload as a setup_config dict
   through this module's own fail-closed validation — the pack
   layer adds identity, versioning, and a conformance record
   around the channel, never a second content path.
   resolve_setup_config() layers the core/default pack
   under a specified pack (§1.3 resolution: the pack's
   declared keys govern, undeclared keys keep the core
   defaults the core pack carries).

5. DOMAIN FRAMING. The proposer and pair-judge
   base templates are domain-neutral core text; a family's
   domain framing (proposer_framing / slot_framing / slot_rules
   / pair_judge_generic_relation) is profile data, accessed via
   the helpers at the bottom of this module and threaded by
   stage_candidates. Before this, the core templates carried
   one family's (CUAD's) contract text as the compiled-in
   default, and the pair judge's evidence template named
   BioRED's "Association" in core code.

# Industry packs (docs/PACK_DESIGN.md).
#
# A pack is the versioned home of one domain's content. Its
# manifest (packs/<pack_id>/pack.json) names the profile payload
# it binds — a setup_config file, pinned by sha256 — so the pack
# never forks content: the payload stays the single source the
# profile channel consumes, and the pin is the definition-fixing
# rule made executable. Loading is fail-closed in the #51 sense:
# a malformed manifest, a payload whose bytes no longer match
# the pin, or a payload that fails setup_config validation all
# refuse to load, naming the reason. A pack whose pin verifies
# and whose payload validates loads to exactly the setup_config
# dict the channel already consumes — byte-identical behavior is
# proven by scripts/test_pack_v0.py.
#
# RESOLUTION. resolve_setup_config()
# layers the core/default pack (packs/core/) under a
# specified domain pack: the core payload is the baseline,
# and for each key the specified pack declares, the pack's
# value governs — for every key it does not declare, the
# core default governs (docs/PACK_DESIGN.md §1.3).
# Both layers load through pack_setup_config, so both pins
# verify and both payloads validate before the merge; the
# merged dict is validated again, and any failure refuses the
# whole resolution — there is no fallback to the baseline
# under a specified pack's name (§1.4).
