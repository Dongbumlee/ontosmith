"""The connection layer: per-seat provider bindings.

OntoSmith's pipeline never names a provider. It names a
**seat** — a capability tier with a defined job (docs/
connections.md) — and this layer binds each seat to a
concrete endpoint: an OpenAI-compatible base URL, a model
name, and an API key read from an environment variable.

The shipped **reference preset** (``pipeline/
reference_profile.py``) fills the measured seats with the
bindings the published quality record was measured with,
so a default install reproduces the published
measurements. (The drafting seat is the one exception:
it ships unbound — see the declaration surface below.)
Any user override makes the run a **custom binding**;
batch records state which binding produced a run
(``Bindings.provenance()`` — host + model per seat, never
a key).

Declaration surface: environment variables.
Connection settings across this codebase are env-only
(``OPENROUTER_API_KEY``, ``NEO4J_*``), and keys must
never land in a file: an override names the key's
environment variable, never its value. Per seat ``S``
(one of PROPOSER, JUDGE, ESCALATION, DRAFTING, EMBEDDER;
upper-case in the variable names):

  ONTOSMITH_<S>_BASE_URL      base URL for the seat
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_MODEL         model name for the seat
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_KEY_ENV       env var holding the key
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_DECISIONS_URL decisions-route override
                              (judge / escalation seats)
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_DIALECT       provider dialect (below)
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_PRICE_IN_PER_MTOK / _PRICE_OUT_PER_MTOK
                              optional user-declared rates
                              (below)
  ONTOSMITH_<S>_CAPABILITIES  capability declarations
                              (below)

Provider dialects (provider generalization):
a binding declares which request/response dialect its
route speaks. ``openrouter`` (the shipped preset) may add
OpenRouter-only request fields (``provider.sort``,
``usage.include``, the ``reasoning`` block) and its
responses carry a provider-reported ``usage.cost``.
``openai`` (the default for custom bindings) is the
portable OpenAI-compatible subset only: no provider-only
fields are emitted, and responses are not expected to
carry a cost. A seat's **cost basis** follows from its
declaration: ``provider-reported`` (openrouter dialect),
``estimated`` (the user declared per-seat rates, below),
or ``not-provided``. ``ONTOSMITH_DIALECT`` sets the
dialect globally, overridden per seat.

User-declared rates: a cost-less route can still be
metered if the user declares what they pay —
``ONTOSMITH_<S>_PRICE_IN_PER_MTOK`` and
``ONTOSMITH_<S>_PRICE_OUT_PER_MTOK`` (USD per million
tokens; both or neither). Costs computed from them are
stamped ``cost_basis: estimated`` — config data declared
by the user, never a product price table. Without rates
(or a cost-reporting dialect), cost is ``None``
(``not-provided``): a USD spend cap cannot guard spend
it cannot meter, so batch create/run refuse by name
(:class:`BindingCostError`) when a cap is set on a
cost-less binding.

Capabilities: model-behavior switches (a model rejecting
non-default temperature; a reasoning model needing the
completion-token parameter) are declared per binding,
not guessed from name substrings at call sites.
``ONTOSMITH_<S>_CAPABILITIES`` is a comma-separated list
(``no-temperature``, ``reasoning-tokens``; an empty value
declares none). Undeclared, the capabilities derive from
the seat's model id by the connection layer's derivation
rules — the same rules, stated once, that the call sites
used to apply ad hoc.

The drafting seat ships **unbound**: the preset
declares its endpoint coordinates but no model — drafting
is an authoring aid behind the human approve gate, not
part of the measured pipeline, so no model is presented
as its default. A drafting call resolves its model from
the user's declaration only (``ONTOSMITH_DRAFTING_MODEL``
or the caller's model option) and refuses with a named
error (:class:`BindingModelError`) before any request
when none is bound.

Globals, overridden per seat:
  ONTOSMITH_BASE_URL, ONTOSMITH_KEY_ENV

Resolution order per field: per-seat variable, then the
global variable (base URL / key env only), then the
reference preset. Resolution reads the environment at
call time; nothing is cached.

Refusal rule: a seat that is *used* resolves its key
through :meth:`SeatBinding.require_key`, which raises
:class:`BindingKeyError` naming the seat and the key
variable when that variable is unset or empty — a
declared-but-broken binding never quietly substitutes
the preset's key or endpoint. The embedder seat has no
fallback at all: an embedder use whose key cannot be
resolved refuses the same way, declared or not.
