"""Batch CLI: create, run, status, rollback batches.

The batch path is the product's build engine. Every run moves
through the stage contract

    INGEST -> NER -> CANDIDATES -> GATES -> ROUTE -> WRITE
           -> INDEX -> VERIFY

with per-stage state persisted under the batch directory, so a
run can resume after failure without redoing completed stages.

Batch state (the batches/ tree, the registry) lives under
state_root() — see its docstring; shipped data (packs) is
resolved against ROOT through the pack candidates, never
against the state root.

Usage:
    python -m pipeline batch create --source <name> --collection <coll> --docs <glob>
    python -m pipeline batch run <batch_id>
    python -m pipeline batch status <batch_id>
    python -m pipeline batch rollback <batch_id> --run <run_id>
    python -m pipeline batch list
    python -m pipeline batch er-review <batch_id>
    python -m pipeline batch er-decide <batch_id> --pair <id> --merge|--keep-separate
    python -m pipeline batch er-apply <batch_id>
