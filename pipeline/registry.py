"""EntityRegistry and GraphStore interfaces.

Design decision (2026-10-10):
- EntityRegistry = system of record (source of truth for entities)
- GraphStore = derived view optimized for RAG traversals
- Interfaces are separate NOW; physical separation LATER.
- Today: Neo4j implements GraphStore. Registry starts simple.

Write ordering (registry-first):
1. EntityRegistry: resolve + merge entities → on failure: nothing happened
2. GraphStore: write triples referencing registry IDs
   → on failure: orphan entities in registry (harmless)
Never reverse: graph-first risks edges pointing to nothing.
