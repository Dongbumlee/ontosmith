"""Ontology builder: draft -> validate ->
approve -> emit, productizing the lab's setup-service loop.

The lab proved the loop for *profile claims*: setup_service
(stage 0) samples a corpus, a drafting-tier model drafts claims,
deterministic scanners re-measure them, and unresolved items go
to a human decision-point list (the approval-brief pattern).
What the lab never had is the same loop for the *schema itself*
— the schema_front inventory (entity/relation types,
definitions, boundary examples) that a pack carries. BioRED
pack v0 was bound by a manual design pass. This module is that
missing builder:

  1. DRAFT. From a stage-0 corpus profile plus a domain brief,
     produce a draft schema document (kind
     ``ontology_schema_draft``). The draft context carries the
     profile's measured census as lists (the semantic census:
     recurring defined terms, binding names, clause headings)
     and the profile's document survey (head and tail of each
     sampled document), so the drafting seat decides about
     recurring corpus terrain explicitly instead of never
     seeing it. Drafting assistance is a
     *capability-tier role* (``drafting`` — the escalation
     tier): the caller binds it in the connection layer (the
     reference profile's preset is one such binding) and passes
     a drafter callable in. This module names no model; with no
     drafter it seeds a deterministic skeleton from the brief,
     whose gaps validation then names one by one.
     A draft after the first may be a REVISION of an
     existing pack rather than a fresh composition: the
     caller may pass the previous pack version's
     schema_front as a *seed*, and the draft then carries
     the seed with it (see ``draft_schema``). The drafting
     rules inherit the seed's types, relations and
     signature pairs; removing one, shrinking a signature,
     or rewriting an inherited definition is allowed only
     with a structured decision point recording the reason,
     and validation enforces that (stage 2). A revision may
     also carry a *hole report* — named families that
     processing reported holes for — which the revision
     must address as one bundle (new relation, signature
     extension with its definition revision, definition
     consistency fix) or explicitly leave open with a
     decision point. That bundle is the augmentation loop's
     revision path.
     The CLI names the two situations as modes, because a
     pack id is a technical coincidence, not an intention:
     a plain ``draft`` composes fresh from the brief — even
     when a published pack carries the same id — and
     ``draft --from <pack>`` extends the pack the caller
     names (a pack id resolved in the repo's packs/ tree,
     or a path to a schema document). Extension is the
     only path that inherits: the seed is the existing map,
     the profile's material (claims, semantic census,
     document survey) is the NEW documents the map must
     grow to cover, and the run prints which mode it is in.
     A material guide rides the draft command's output —
     under 10 documents of material a strong warning, at
     10–29 a recommendation note (the measured composition
     trajectory is still growing through that range and
     settles around 30 documents); the guide warns, it
     never blocks.
  2. VALIDATE. Deterministic, fail-closed checks over the
     draft: every type carries a definition and boundary
     examples; no duplicate or colliding type names; no
     overlapping types without a declared boundary (boundary
     declarations are structured decision points, and a
     revision that adds, re-signs or redefines a relation
     must declare its boundary with every relation it
     shares a signature pair with); relation
     endpoint signatures (type names or "TypeA~TypeB" pair
     strings, the shipped shape) stay inside the entity
     inventory;
     definitions live in exactly one place (the schema_front —
     the single-source rule); and the would-be pack payload
     passes the same fail-closed setup_config validation as
     any profile config (the pack contract, PACK_DESIGN §1).
     Every defect is a named finding; nothing is repaired
     silently.
  3. APPROVE. The human decision point is explicit, mirroring
     the lab's approval-record pattern: approval is a separate
     record bound to the draft's schema hash, produced only
     for a draft that validates clean. A draft cannot become
     in_force without one.
  4. EMIT. An approved draft emits a pack skeleton in the
     shipped layout — pack.json (payload pinned by sha256),
     profile/setup_config.json, and a conformance stub that
     records the emission honestly as *unmeasured*: the pack
     exists as approval-bound data; pricing it is a registered
     conformance measurement (PACK_DESIGN §2), not a builder
     claim. Emission refuses without a matching approval, and
     the emitted pack is self-checked through the staged
     loader before emit returns.

Domain content is data throughout: the schema lives in the
draft document and then in the pack payload, never in code —
this module has no domain branch. The core-pack path is the
intended use: a user with no domain pack drafts, validates,
gets approval, and emits their own pack.

_SCHEMA_DRAFT_SYSTEM = """You are drafting an ontology schema for a
knowledge-graph construction pipeline, from a corpus profile and a
domain brief. The schema is a CLOSED inventory: only the types you
declare will ever be extracted.

Rules:
- Output ONLY JSON: {"schema_front": {...},
  "merge_prohibited_type_pairs": [[typeA, typeB], ...],
  "decision_points": [...]}.
- schema_front: {"purpose": <one paragraph: what this schema is
  for>, "entity_inventory": [...], "relation_inventory": [...]}.
- Each entity entry: {"type": <name>, "role": "entity" (or a
  qualifier role for context-only types), "definition": <one
  precise paragraph>, "form_examples": [<typical surface forms>],
  "not_entities": {<category>: [<boundary examples that must NOT
  be extracted as this type>]}}. An entity entry MAY declare
  "attributes": [{"name": <snake_case>, "value_type":
  "date"|"datetime"|"number"|"money"|"duration"|"identifier",
  "required": <bool>, "multi": <bool>, "definition": <what the
  value is>}] — the values the corpus states ABOUT this type
  (an agreement's effective date, a contract's value). Values
  are NOT entities: when the corpus terrain is a date, an
  amount, a period or an identifier, declare it as an
  attribute of the type it belongs to — never as an entity
  type, and never as a relation endpoint. Declare an
  attribute only where the corpus states such values
  recurrently; "required" means the value must be captured
  whenever a document states it.
- Each relation entry: {"type": <name>, "definition": <one
  precise paragraph>, "endpoint_signature": [<entity type
  names>], "boundary_examples": [<statements or near-miss cases
  that mark this relation's boundary>]}. You may add "direction":
  "directed"|"symmetric" and "inverse_of": <relation name> where
  the corpus supports them.
- Every type needs a definition AND boundary material: boundary
  examples are what separate this type from its neighbours.
- The context carries a semantic census (defined terms that
  recur across documents, the names they bind to, recurring
  clause/section headings) and a document survey — read the
  survey TAILS as well as the heads; closing terrain (governing
  law, venue, term, signatures) lives in tails. Treat every
  recurring census family as terrain the schema must decide
  about explicitly: cover it with a type or relation, or record
  in "decision_points" why it is out of scope. Silence about a
  recurring family is not a decision.
- Signature attestation: every endpoint-signature pair you
  declare must rest on an instance the survey or census
  material attests. A pair with no attested instance is not
  a harmless extra — it promises a structure the corpus
  does not contain; leave it out, or (when a revision adds
  it to an inherited relation) carry it on an
  extend_signature record whose "evidence" states plainly
  that it is declared without an attested instance, and why.
- Boundary declarations: before finishing, walk every pair of
  sibling types (entity-entity and relation-relation) whose
  definitions could both match the same statement. For each
  such pair, declare the boundary as a STRUCTURED decision
  point: {"action": "declare_boundary", "kind":
  "entity"|"relation", "types": [<name A>, <name B>],
  "boundary": "distinct"|"includes"|"included_in",
  "reason": <what each side includes and excludes, and the
  test that separates them>} — "includes" states the first
  type covers the second (a subtype relation),
  "included_in" the reverse, "distinct" that the two are
  mutually exclusive. Free text never settles a boundary.
  In a revision, validation rejects the draft when a
  relation you added, re-signed or redefined shares a
  signature pair with another relation and no declaration
  settles the two. A confusable pair with no declaration is
  an undeclared boundary.
- Definitions stay at the breadth the corpus attests: a
  boundary is won in "decision_points" and boundary
  examples, never by narrowing a definition. Do not add a
  membership condition (a named originator, a form, a
  provenance) that would exclude instances the corpus
  itself treats as the type, unless that condition IS the
  test separating a declared pair — an extra condition is
  over-narrowing, and every instance it excludes becomes
  a silent extraction hole.
- Do not declare a new relation that merely reverses an
  existing one (a "parent of" beside an existing "child
  of"): declare "inverse_of" on one side instead, so the
  pair is extracted once and read in both directions.
- SEED INHERITANCE. When the context carries a
  "seed_schema_front", this draft is a revision of that
  schema, not a fresh composition. The profile, claims,
  semantic census and document survey in the context
  describe the NEW documents this revision extends the
  schema to cover; the seed is the existing map. Terrain
  the seed already covers needs no new declarations —
  the revision's work is what the new material shows
  that the seed does not cover, decided against the
  seed. Inherit every seed
  entity type, relation type and endpoint-signature pair.
  Additions are free. A removal or shrinkage is allowed
  only with a structured decision point recording the
  reason — an object of the form {"action": "remove_type",
  "kind": "entity"|"relation", "type": <name>, "reason":
  <why>} for a dropped type, {"action": "remove_signature",
  "kind": "relation", "type": <relation>, "detail":
  <the dropped signature entry>, "reason": <why>} for a
  dropped signature pair, or {"action": "revise_definition"
  (or "narrow_definition"), "kind": ..., "type": <name>,
  "reason": <why>} for any rewrite of an inherited
  definition. Validation rejects an unjustified removal,
  shrinkage or silent definition rewrite. A signature pair
  ADDITION must ride with the definition revision that
  keeps the definition consistent with the widened
  signature; if the existing definition already covers
  the added pair, say so in an {"action":
  "extend_signature", "kind": "relation", "type": <name>,
  "evidence": <the corpus instance the added pair rests
  on — or an explicit statement that it is declared
  without an attested instance, and why>, "reason":
  <why the definition already covers it>} decision point
  instead. An extend_signature record with no evidence
  justifies nothing. Declared VALUE ATTRIBUTES inherit
  under the same discipline: adding an attribute, relaxing
  its "required" flag or widening its "multi" flag is free;
  dropping a declared attribute takes {"action":
  "remove_attribute", "kind": "entity", "type": <entity
  type>, "detail": <attribute name>, "reason": <why>}, and
  changing an attribute's "value_type", strengthening
  "required" (false to true), narrowing "multi", or
  rewriting the attribute's definition takes {"action":
  "revise_attribute", "kind": "entity", "type": <entity
  type>, "detail": <attribute name>, "reason": <why>}.
- HOLE REPORT. When the context carries a "hole_report",
  it names families that processing reported holes for.
  Address each family in this revision as one bundle —
  a new relation, a signature extension with its
  definition revision, or a definition consistency fix —
  or record in "decision_points" why that family stays
  open. A named family left silent is an unmade decision.
- Definitions live ONLY in the schema_front entries — nowhere
  else in your output.
- Be specific to THIS corpus and brief. No generic advice, no
  configuration, no model names, no thresholds."""
