"""Identity surface damage — regression tests from the
ontology scale-test pilot (2026-10-29, 60 docs, Cindy seat).

The pilot's largest single loss class was not the schema:
15 of 284 kept candidates (5.3%) carried endpoints the
identity layer itself had damaged, in both directions:

- absorption UP into a containing phrase: "Afghanistan"
  rewritten to the title phrase "Attorney General of
  Afghanistan"; the place "Los Angeles" rewritten to the
  album "Battle of Los Angeles"; "Cedar Brook" rewritten
  to the coordination "South Plainfield and the Cedar
  Brook"; "Amdír" to the prose-glued "Similarly Amdír";
  a school name absorbing a trailing "To" from the next
  sentence (the source text has no period there).
- trimming DOWN of quoted titles: the census nickname
  rule (Name "Nick" Name) fired on quote-OPENED titles —
  "Suffer the Children" censused as "the Children" with
  the full title demoted to an alias, "Days Like This"
  as "Like This", "El Regalo Más Grande" lost its "El" —
  and resolution then rewrote correct endpoints down to
  the fragments.
- a nickname-headed mention form ("Mike Padden" for
  Michael John "Mike" Padden) resolved nowhere and was
  attestation-blocked although the census itself folds
  exactly that form among its own surfaces.

The repairs are deterministic and sit in the same two
places as the damage: the census nickname rule requires
a plain name token before the quoted token (a quote that
opens the mention marks a title, not an inserted
nickname); subset absorption is vetoed when the extra
tokens are function words, prose openers, or role/title
words (absorption may complete a name with name material
only); and a nickname-headed endpoint folds to its
entity exactly as census surfaces fold.

# of English type nouns (university, senate, corporation,
# ...) — a per-language word list, and word lists are not
# a mechanism. The bake-off that replaced it measured
# what the list uniquely covered and found the coverage
# was an instance of one rule: a subset rewrite needs
# document-supplied identity evidence (see
# _rewrite_evidence), whatever the fragment's length.
# The list is gone. Two specified behaviours fall out of
# the general rule and are pinned here: a longer name the
# document attests only once does not complete a mention
# that has its own textual life (the mention stands, the
# fact is kept), and leading/trailing glue around a name
# (a show's title around a country) is refused on the
# same evidence grounds, not on the words involved.
